  	  Meant for practice with conditional statements 
  Assignment 3: A program that acts as fake bank where the user inputs how much they wish to deposit or withdraw from their account and prints their balance.
  	  Meant for practice with do while loops and methods
  Assignment 4: A program that creates a seating plan given the user's inputs

Data Structures and Algorithms course
  cois2020A1 (Assignment 1):  A program that takes polynomials that a user inputs, sorts them, and lets the user add or multiply the polynomial with other polynomials.
	  Meant for practice with Array Lists and Linked Lists
  COIS2020HA2 (Assignment 2): A program that uses a priority queue to implement and Huffman Tree and encode a given text, display the Binary Heap, and decode the text.
	  Meant for practice with implementing a Binary Heap and traversing a Binary Tree
  A3_V2 (Assignment 3): A program that simulates a file system using left- child right-sibling tree. The program can add directories and files while also removing them. 
	  Meant for practice with recursive algorithms.
